[mod-setting-description]
ff-allow-multiple-players-in-create=If this option is disabled (DEFAULT), then anybody can use /create-force, will take a single argument of <force_name> and will only initially create team with the command-issuer.\n\nIf this option is enabled, then /create-team will require Host/server admin privileges.
